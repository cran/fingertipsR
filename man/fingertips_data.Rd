\usage{
fingertips_data(IndicatorID = NULL, AreaCode = NULL, DomainID = NULL,
  ProfileID = NULL, AreaTypeID = 102, ParentAreaTypeID = NULL,
  categorytype = FALSE, inequalities, rank = FALSE,
  stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors())
}
\arguments{
\item{IndicatorID}{Numeric vector, id of the indicator of interest}

\item{AreaCode}{Character vector, ONS area code of area of interest}

\item{DomainID}{Numeric vector, id of domains of interest}

\item{ProfileID}{Numeric vector, id of profiles of interest. Indicator
polarity can vary between profiles therefore if using one of the comparison
fields it is recommended to complete this field as well as IndicatorID. If
IndicatorID is populated, ProfileID can be ignored or must be the same
length as IndicatorID (but can contain NAs).}

\item{AreaTypeID}{Numeric vector, the Fingertips ID for the area type;
default is 102}

\item{ParentAreaTypeID}{Numeric vector, the comparator area type for the data
extracted; if NULL the function will use the first record for the specified
`AreaTypeID` from the area_types() function}

\item{categorytype}{TRUE or FALSE, determines whether the final table
includes categorytype data where it exists. Default to FALSE}

\item{inequalities}{deprecated: TRUE or FALSE, same as categorytype}

\item{rank}{TRUE or FALSE, the rank of the area compared to other areas for
that combination of indicator, sex, age, categorytype and category along
with the indicator's polarity. 1 is lowest NAs will be bottom and ties will
return the average position. The total count of areas with a non-NA value
are returned also in AreaValuesCount}

\item{stringsAsFactors}{logical: should character vectors be converted to
factors? The 'factory-fresh' default is TRUE, but this can be changed by
setting options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE).}
}
\value{
