This worked example attempts to document a common workflow a user might follow when using the `fingertipsR` package.

Suppose you want to plot healthy life expectancy and life expectancy by deprivation for a given year of data that fingertips contains - you will begin by wondering *where to start*.

## Where to start

There is one function in the `fingertipsR` package that extracts data from the Fingertips API: `fingertips_data()`. This function has the following inputs:

* IndicatorID
* AreaCode
* DomainID
* ProfileID
* AreaTypeID (this defaults to 102; County and Unitary Authority)
* ParentAreaTypeID (this defaults to 6; Government Office Region)

One of *IndicatorID*, *DomainID* or *ProfileID* must be complete. *AreaCode* needs completion if you are extracting data for a particular area or group of areas only. *AreaTypeID* determines the geography to extract the data for. In this case we want County and Unitary Authority level. *ParentAreaTypeID* requires an area type code that the *AreaTypeID* maps to.

Therefore, the inputs to the `fingertips_data` function that we need to find out are the ID codes for:

* IndicatorID 
* AreaTypeID
* ParentAreaTypeID

We need to begin by calling the `fingertipsR` package: 


## IndicatorID

There are two indicators we are interested in for this exercise. Without consulting the [Fingertips website](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/  "Fingertips"), we know approximately what they are called:

* Healthy life expectancy
* Life expectancy

We can use the `indicators()` function to return a list of all the indicators within Fingertips. We can then filter the name field for the term *life expectancy* (note, the IndicatorName field has been converted to lower case in the following code chunk to ensure matches will not be overlooked as a result of upper case letters).


```r
inds <- indicators()
life_expectancy <- inds[grepl("life expectancy", tolower(inds$IndicatorName)),]

# Because the same indicators are used in multiple profiles, there are many repeated indicators in this table (some with varying IndicatorName but same IndicatorID)

# This returns a record for each IndicatorID
life_expectancy <- unique(life_expectancy[duplicated(life_expectancy$IndicatorID) == FALSE,
                                          c("IndicatorID", "IndicatorName")]) 
knitr::kable(life_expectancy, row.names = FALSE)
```

The two indicators we are interested in from this table are:

* 90362
* 90366

## AreaTypeID

We can work out what the *AreaTypeID* codes we are interested in using the function `area_types()`. We've decided that we want to produce the graph at County and Unitary Authority level. From the section [Where to start] we need codes for *AreaTypeID* and *ParentAreaTypeID.*
